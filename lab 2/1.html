<h1 class="bg-blue lightgreen  p-1 pt m4 " >what is html</h1>
<p class="p">HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage by using a series of elements, each defined by tags, to tell web browsers how to display text, images, and other multimedia content. It's a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it's used for structuring and formatting content rather than defining logic or behavior. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Markup Language:
HTML uses tags to structure content, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. 
Structure:
It provides the basic skeleton of a webpage, defining how elements are arranged and displayed. 
Content:
HTML elements encompass the text, images, and other media that make up a webpage's content. 
Browsers:
Web browsers interpret the HTML code and render the webpage accordingly. 
Relationship with CSS and JavaScript:
While HTML provides the structure, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and visual presentation, and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.
